Rails404
========

Rails404 is a easy way to generate 404 and 500 pages that have your current layout. It's based upon this blog post http://blog.peelmeagrape.net/2008/8/14/pre-generating-rails-404-and-500-pages-using-layouts-and-rake#disqus_thread which is based off this blog post http://stateofflux.com/2008/7/14/generate-static-pages-in-rails/ and I still don't quite like this solution but it's the best I've found for handling 404 and 500 pages in Rails with layouts that frequently change.

Note: The domain for non-relative paths is gotten form APP_CONFIG[:site_url] if not provided it defaults to 'www.example.com'.

Tested on Rails 2.3


Example
=======

Run "rake generate:static_pages RAILS_ENV=production" to generate the pages. Or add a cap hook

namespace :deploy do
  task :generate_static_pages do
    invoke_command "cd #{release_path} && rake generate:static_pages RAILS_ENV=#{rails_env}" 
  end
end

after "deploy:finalize_update", "deploy:generate_static_pages"
